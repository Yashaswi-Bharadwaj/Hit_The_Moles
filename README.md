# Hit_The_Moles
This code is built by "YASHASWI P BHARADWAJ".
This code implements the "Hit The Moles" game that was built for the earlier Java mobile phones. 

The description of the game is :-
    Out of the 9 positions available, the code generates the key positions to be targeted and the key positions 
  where the Bombs will be placed. The user is allowed to play a game for 60secs at one trial. If the user 
  selects the empty position, the time will be decreased without any changes to the grid.
  
  Once the user clicks the Bomb or ran out of the time, the game gets terminated. At every instant of time, the Score 
  and the Time remaining is displayed. At the end, the reason for termination of the game will be displayed along with 
  the score of the user.
  
  
I welcome comments and improvements (if any) for the code.
